\section{Problem 1}
The code for Problem 1 is contained in the source file named ``yale\_chang\_hw2\_p1.cpp''.\\

\section{Problem 2}
1. The algorithm compute the sum of the squares of 1 to $n$, i.e. $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^2$.\\
\\
2. The basic operations are multiplication and summation.\\
\\
3. Since the loop is executed for $n$ times and there's only one summation and multiplication in every loop, the summation and multiplication are both executed for $n$ times.\\
\\
4. $O(n)$.\\
\\
5. The C++ code is contained in the source file named ``yale\_chang\_hw2\_p2.cpp''. The basic idea is to use the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\end{equation*}
In this algorithm, the summation is executed for 2 times and the multiplication is executed for 3 times and the division is executed for 1 time. So the time complexity for this algorithm is $O(1)$.
